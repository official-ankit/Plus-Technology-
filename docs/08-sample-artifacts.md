```
- A) 2.5 1
- B) 2 1 ✓
- C) 2.5 0.5
- D) 2.0 1.0

- C) `do-while` loop ✓
- D) None of the above

---

- A) 4
- B) 5
- C) 20 ✓
- D) Depends on compiler

---

**Q5.** Which statement about pointers is FALSE?
- A) Pointers store memory addresses
- B) `*ptr` dereferences a pointer
- C) Pointers cannot point to arrays ✓ (FALSE - this is wrong, pointers CAN point to arrays)
- D) `&var` gets the address of `var`

---

**Q6.** What does `void` mean as a function return type?
- A) The function returns 0
- B) The function returns nothing ✓
- C) The function is invalid
- D) The function returns a void pointer

---

**Q7.** What is the default access specifier for class members?

- B) `private` ✓
- C) `protected`
- D) `internal`

---

**Q8.** Which is the correct syntax for a function prototype?

- C) `function add(int, int): int;`
- D) `def add(int, int) -> int;`

---

### Section B: Short Answer (20 points, 5 questions)

**Q9.** What is the output of this code? (4 points)
```cpp
int x = 10;
int *p = &x;
*p = 20;
cout << x;
```

**Answer:** `20`

*Explanation: `p` points to `x`. `*p = 20` modifies the value at that address, which is `x`.*

---

**Q10.** Complete the blank to make this a valid string declaration: (4 points)
```cpp
_______ name = "John";
```

**Answer:** `string` or `const char*`

---

**Q11.** What is the difference between `++i` and `i++`? (4 points)

**Answer:**
- `++i` (pre-increment): Increments first, then returns the new value
- `i++` (post-increment): Returns the current value, then increments

---

**Q12.** Write the output: (4 points)
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

**Answer:**
```
*
**
***
```

---

**Q13.** What is a constructor and when is it called? (4 points)

**Answer:** A constructor is a special member function with the same name as the class. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize object members.

---

### Section C: Coding Tasks (40 points, 2 questions)

**Q14.** Write a function that takes an array of integers and its size, and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array. (20 points)

**Starter Code:**
```cpp
int sumOfEvens(int arr[], int size) {
    // Your code here
}
```

**Sample Solution:**
```cpp
int sumOfEvens(int arr[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

**Rubric:**
| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Correct loop iteration | 5 |
| Correct even check | 5 |

- Private members: `length` and `width` (both `double`)
- Constructor that initializes both dimensions
- Member function `area()` that returns the area
- Member function `perimeter()` that returns the perimeter
- Member function `isSquare()` that returns `true` if length equals width

**Sample Solution:**
```cpp
class Rectangle {
private:
    double length;
    double width;

public:
    Rectangle(double l, double w) : length(l), width(w) {}

    double area() {
        return length * width;
    }

    double perimeter() {
        return 2 * (length + width);
    }

    bool isSquare() {
        return length == width;
    }
};
```

**Rubric:**
| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Correct class declaration | 3 |
| Private members | 2 |
| Constructor with initialization | 4 |
| area() implementation | 3 |
| perimeter() implementation | 3 |
| isSquare() implementation | 3 |
